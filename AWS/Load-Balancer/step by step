 *🧭 Step-by-Step: AWS Load Balancer & Auto Scaling*

⚖️ 1. AWS Load Balancer
📌 What is it?
A Load Balancer:

Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances

Acts as a single point of service access

Ensures reliability and high availability

🔁 Purpose:
“We need a service that balances traffic across multiple servers.”

🌍 2. How Load Balancer Works
Multiple EC2 Instances (e.g., 5 servers)

Load Balancer sits in front of them

Traffic from 100s to 1000s of users is distributed evenly

Prevents overload on a single server

Example:
Users	Distributed To
100	EC2 Instance 1
200	EC2 Instance 2
500	EC2 Instance 3 & 4 (etc.)

📊 3. Auto Scaling
Auto Scaling adjusts resources automatically based on load.

🔼 Vertical Scaling (Up/Down):
Add more power to a single instance

Example:

Increase CPU → 8 vCPU

Increase RAM → 16 GB

↔️ Horizontal Scaling (Out/In):
Add more instances

Example:

Scale out from 1 instance to 2 or more

Each handles a part of the total user load (e.g., 2000 users)

💡 4. Use Case Example:
Scenario:
You have 1 EC2 instance handling 1000 users

Your user load increases to 2000 users

Options:
Vertical Scaling: Upgrade the same instance
e.g., from 1 vCPU/1GB to 8 vCPU/16GB
➤ This is Up/Down Scaling

Horizontal Scaling: Add more EC2 instances
➤ This is Out/In Scaling

------------------------------------
🧭 Step-by-Step: Auto Scaling — Vertical vs Horizontal

🔄 What is Auto Scaling?
Auto Scaling automatically adjusts your EC2 capacity based on demand:

📈 Scale Up / Scale Out when demand increases

📉 Scale Down / Scale In when demand decreases

📊 Scaling Types Overview
Type	Direction	Description
Vertical	Up / Down	Increase or decrease power of a single machine
Horizontal	Out / In	Add or remove EC2 instances

🧠 Definitions:
Scale Up = Add more power to one instance (CPU, RAM, etc.)

Scale Out = Deploy more instances to handle more traffic

🔼 A) Vertical Scaling – "Scale Up" Example:
CPU	RAM	Capacity
8 vCPU	16 GB	~1000 users
16 vCPU	32 GB	~20000 users

✅ Use when:

You can't change architecture

Apps aren't built to run on multiple nodes

⚠️ Limits:

There is a hardware ceiling

Downtime may be needed to resize instance

↔️ B) Horizontal Scaling – "Scale Out" Example:
Instance Count	CPU per Instance	RAM per Instance	Total Capacity
1	8 vCPU	16 GB	1000 users
5	8 vCPU	16 GB each	5000 users

✅ Use when:

Your app is stateless or supports distributed processing

You need fault tolerance and zero downtime

🧩 Key AWS Tools:

Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

Load Balancer (to distribute load)

💡 Learning Tip:
Think of vertical scaling as buying a bigger machine

Think of horizontal scaling as adding more machines

📘 Best Practice:
Prefer horizontal scaling in cloud-native architecture because it offers:

Better availability

Greater fault tolerance

Easier to scale indefinitely

------------------------------------------

Step-by-Step Guide to Auto Scaling & Scaling Strategies
1. Understanding Auto Scaling
Auto Scaling is a cloud feature that automatically adjusts compute resources based on workload demands.
It ensures optimal performance and cost-efficiency by:

Scaling Out (Horizontal Scaling) → Adding more instances.

Scaling In (Horizontal Scaling) → Removing instances when demand decreases.

2. When to Use Auto Scaling?
Predictable Workloads (e.g., scheduled traffic spikes).

Unpredictable Workloads (e.g., sudden traffic surges).

3. Key Auto Scaling Parameters
Parameter	Description
Minimum Capacity	Baseline number of instances always running (e.g., 2).
Maximum Capacity	Upper limit of instances to prevent over-provisioning (e.g., 10).
Desired Capacity	Optimal number of instances at a given time (e.g., 4).
4. Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out/In)
How it Works:

Scale-Out: Adds instances when demand increases (e.g., CPU > 80%).

Scale-In: Removes instances when demand drops (e.g., CPU < 30%).

Best For:

Stateless applications (e.g., web servers, microservices).

5. Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up/Down)
How it Works:

Scale-Up: Upgrades instance size (e.g., from t2.small to t2.large).

Scale-Down: Downgrades instance size when demand decreases.

Best For:

Stateful applications (e.g., traditional databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL).

6. Database Scaling Challenges
Traditional Databases (SQL):

Do NOT support horizontal scaling easily (due to consistency requirements).

Solution: Use vertical scaling (upgrade CPU/RAM/storage).

Modern Databases (NoSQL, NewSQL):

Support horizontal scaling (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

7. Workload Scenarios & Auto Scaling
Scenario	Action	Example
Predictable	Scheduled scaling (e.g., 9 AM–5 PM peak).	E-commerce during Black Friday.
Unpredictable	Reactive scaling (e.g., traffic spikes).	Breaking news causing web traffic surge.
8. Step-by-Step Auto Scaling Setup (AWS Example)
Define Scaling Policy:

Set metrics (CPU, memory, request count).

Configure thresholds (e.g., scale-out at 70% CPU).

Set Capacity Limits:

Min: 2, Max: 10, Desired: 4.

Test Scaling:

Simulate load to trigger scaling events.

Monitor & Optimize:

Use CloudWatch to adjust thresholds.

9. Best Practices
For Databases:

Use read replicas (limited horizontal scaling).

Consider sharding for distributed databases.

For Cost Control:

Set conservative max limits.

Use spot instances for non-critical workloads.

Summary
Horizontal Scaling (Auto Scaling): Best for dynamic, stateless workloads.

Vertical Scaling: Required for traditional databases.

Workload Types: Adjust scaling policies based on predictability.

Step-by-Step: AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) Setup
1. Understand Load Balancer Types
Type	Protocol Support	OSI Layer	Use Case
Application LB (ALB)	HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets	Layer 7	Web apps, microservices, path-based routing.
Network LB (NLB)	TCP, UDP, TLS	Layer 4	Low-latency, high-throughput (e.g., gaming, VoIP).
Gateway LB (GWLB)	IP packets (TLS)	Layer 3	Firewalls, intrusion detection (e.g., third-party security appliances).
2. Pre-requisites
VPC with public/private subnets.

Target Groups (EC2 instances, ECS, Lambda).

Security Groups allowing HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

3. Step-by-Step ALB Creation
Step 1: Navigate to AWS EC2 Console
Go to EC2 Dashboard → Load Balancers → Create Load Balancer → Select Application Load Balancer.

Step 2: Basic Configuration
Field	Value/Description
Name	test-alb (Unique, descriptive name).
Scheme	Internet-facing (Public IP) or Internal (Private IP for intra-VPC traffic).
IP Address Type	IPv4 (default) or Dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6) if needed.
Step 3: Network Mapping
VPC: Select your VPC.

Subnets: Choose ≥2 public subnets (for high availability).
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/images/application_load_balancer.png

Step 4: Security Groups
Assign a Security Group allowing:

Inbound: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) from 0.0.0.0/0 (public) or VPC CIDR (internal).

Step 5: Listeners & Routing
Default Listener:

Protocol: HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443).

For HTTPS, upload an SSL/TLS certificate (ACM).

Default Action: Forward to a Target Group (e.g., web-servers).

Step 6: Target Groups
Target Type: EC2, IP, or Lambda.

Health Checks: Configure path (/health) and thresholds (e.g., 200 OK).

Step 7: Review & Create
Verify settings → Click Create Load Balancer.

4. Key ALB Features
Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) Capabilities
Path-Based Routing

Route /api/* to backend microservices, /static/* to S3.

Host-Based Routing

Route blog.example.com and app.example.com to different target groups.

SSL/TLS Offloading

Terminate HTTPS at ALB → HTTP to instances (reduces backend load).

Advanced Use Cases
Sticky Sessions: Enable for stateful apps (uses cookies).

WebSockets: Native support for real-time apps.

Redirects: HTTP → HTTPS, URL rewrites.

5. Comparison: ALB vs. NLB vs. GWLB
Feature	ALB	NLB	GWLB
Protocols	HTTP/HTTPS	TCP/UDP	IP packets (TLS)
Performance	Moderate (Layer 7)	Ultra-low latency	Security-focused
Pricing	Higher (per LCU)	Lower (per NLCU)	Based on traffic
Use Case	Web apps	Gaming, VoIP	Firewall integration
6. Best Practices
Enable Access Logs: Log requests to S3 for analytics.

Use WAF with ALB: Protect against DDoS/SQL injection.

Cross-Zone Load Balancing: Distribute traffic evenly across AZs.

Idle Timeout: Adjust (default: 60s) for long-lived connections.

Summary
ALB = Best for web apps (Layer 7).

NLB = Best for performance (Layer 4).

GWLB = Best for security appliances.

Next Steps:

Attach Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) to ALB for dynamic scaling.

Configure CloudWatch alarms for monitoring.

-------------------------------------
pplication Load Balancer (ALB) in AWS, focusing on the "Network Mapping" and "Security Group" sections. The user has provided some inputs and we need to structure it properly.

Steps to cover:

1. Network Mapping (VPC and Availability Zones)

2. Security Group Configuration

Let's break it down:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### 1. Network Mapping

- **VPC**: Choose the VPC where your load balancer will reside. The user mentioned "default VPC".

- **Availability Zones (AZs)**:

- You must select at least two AZs for high availability.

- The load balancer will span across the selected AZs.

#### 2. Security Group

- **Create a new security group** for the load balancer.

- **Basic details**:

- Security group name: e.g., `loadbalancer-sg`

- Description: Optional but recommended (e.g., "Security group for ALB")

- VPC: Choose the same VPC as above (default VPC)

- **Inbound rules**:

- We need to allow HTTP (port 80) and/or HTTPS (port 443) from the internet.

- Example for HTTP:

- Type: HTTP

- Protocol: TCP

- Port: 80

- Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) [for IPv4] and ::/0 [for IPv6 if needed]

Now, let's write the structured guide accordingly.

Structured Step-by-Step Guide: Network Mapping & Security Group Setup for ALB
Goal: Configure network settings and security for an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) with high availability and security.

Step 1: Network Mapping (VPC & Availability Zones)
Select VPC

Choose your default VPC or a custom VPC.

Best Practice: Use a VPC with public subnets for internet-facing ALBs.

Map Availability Zones (AZs)

Requirement: Select ≥2 AZs (e.g., us-east-1a, us-east-1b).

Why?

Ensures high availability (HA).

Spans ALB nodes across AZs to survive zone failures.

Action:

Check AZs with public subnets.

Enable all AZs where your backend instances (EC2/ECS) run.

Step 2: Security Group Configuration
Purpose: Control traffic to/from the ALB.

A. Create a New Security Group
Field	Value
Security group name	loadbalancer-sg
Description	Allow HTTP/HTTPS to ALB
VPC	Select your default VPC
B. Configure Inbound Rules
Type	Protocol	Port Range	Source	Description
HTTP	TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0	Public web traffic
HTTPS	TCP	443	0.0.0.0/0	Secure web traffic
Source Notes:

0.0.0.0/0 allows global IPv4 access (use for public ALBs).

For internal ALBs: Restrict to VPC CIDR (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

C. Configure Outbound Rules (Default)
Type	Protocol	Port Range	Destination
All traffic	All	All	0.0.0.0/0
Note: ALB outbound rules allow traffic to backend instances.

D. Create the Security Group
Click Create security group.

Step 3: Attach Security Group to ALB
In ALB setup wizard:

Under Security Groups, select loadbalancer-sg.

Validation:

Ensure no other restrictive SGs are attached (e.g., blocking HTTP/HTTPS).

Key Concepts Illustrated
Concept	Configuration Example	Why It Matters
Multi-AZ Deployment	AZs: us-east-1a, us-east-1b	Avoids single point of failure.
Public ALB	Scheme: Internet-facing	Accepts traffic from the internet.
Security	Inbound: HTTP/80 open	Balances accessibility vs. security.
Troubleshooting Tips
ALB Not Responding?

Check SG: Ensure loadbalancer-sg is attached.

Validate AZs: Backend instances must be in mapped AZs.

Verify Subnets: Public subnets required for internet-facing ALBs.

Traffic Blocked?

Ensure backend instances have SGs allowing traffic from loadbalancer-sg.

Next Steps
Configure Listeners (e.g., HTTP:80 → HTTPS:443 redirect).

Set up Target Groups (point to EC2/containers).

Enable Health Checks (e.g., path /health).

----------------------------------------

✅ Step-by-Step: Set Up Load Balancer with Security Group and Target Group in AWS
🔹 1. Create a New Security Group for the Load Balancer
Name: Coddbalancesq (or any descriptive name)

Steps:

Go to EC2 Dashboard → Security Groups

Click on Create Security Group

Name: Coddbalancesq

Description: For Load Balancer access

Inbound Rules:

Type: HTTP

Protocol: TCP

Port Range: 80

Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

Outbound Rules: Leave default (Allow all)

Click Create security group

✅ This SG will be attached to the Load Balancer

🔹 2. Remove Old Security Group (Optional)
Identify the old security group (linked to the old load balancer)

Ensure it's no longer attached to any resources

Go to EC2 > Security Groups

Select the old group

Click Actions > Delete

🔹 3. Create a Load Balancer
Type: Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Steps:

Go to EC2 > Load Balancers

Click Create Load Balancer > Application Load Balancer

Name: e.g., web-alb

Scheme: Internet-facing

Listeners:

Protocol: HTTP

Port: 80

Availability Zones: Select at least 2 subnets

Security Groups: Select the Coddbalancesq SG

Continue to Target Group (next step)

🔹 4. Create a Target Group
Purpose: Targets receive traffic from the load balancer

Steps:

Target Type: Instance (or IP, Lambda as needed)

Name: e.g., web-target-group

Protocol: HTTP

Port: 80

VPC: Select the correct one

Register targets (choose your EC2 instances)

Click Create target group

🔹 5. Listener and Routing Configuration
Steps:

In Listeners > Rules, confirm:

Protocol: HTTP

Port: 80

Default Action: Forward to web-target-group

Save and launch the Load Balancer

🔹 6. Test and Validate
Visit the Load Balancer DNS name (shown in Load Balancer details)

Ensure requests go to your EC2 instance(s)

🔁 Optional: Redirection or Failover
To redirect traffic to another instance if one fails:

Enable Health Checks in your Target Group settings

Ensure EC2 instances in Target Group are in different AZs

Load Balancer automatically redirects requests to healthy targets

------------------------------------------------------

✅ Step-by-Step: Set Up Auto Scaling Group with Health Checks in AWS
🔹 1. Health Check Configuration (for Load Balancer)
This ensures only healthy instances receive traffic.

Settings:

Ping Path: / (default home page or API endpoint)

Protocol: HTTP

Port: 80 (or your app port)

Interval: 30 seconds
→ Time between health checks

Timeout: 5 seconds
→ If no response in 5 seconds, considered a failed ping

Healthy threshold: 5
→ Must pass 5 times to be considered healthy

Unhealthy threshold: 2
→ Fails 2 times → marked unhealthy

Success Codes: 200–399
→ HTTP responses in this range are considered OK

✅ This ensures Load Balancer removes unhealthy instances automatically.

🔹 2. Create a Launch Template
This template defines how new instances should be created.

Steps:

Go to EC2 > Launch Templates

Click Create launch template

Name: e.g., web-launch-template

AMI ID: Select your machine image (e.g., Amazon Linux or Ubuntu)

Instance type: e.g., t3.micro

Key pair: (Select existing or create new)

Security group: Same one used for target (e.g., web SG)

Storage: Configure volume if needed

Click Create launch template

🔹 3. Create Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
This group will use the launch template to auto-scale EC2 instances.

Steps:

Go to EC2 > Auto Scaling Groups

Click Create Auto Scaling Group

Name: e.g., web-asg

Launch Template: Select the one you just created

VPC & Subnets: Choose the same VPC and subnets used by your Load Balancer

Attach to Load Balancer:

Select existing ALB

Choose the correct Target Group

Health Checks:

Type: EC2 + ELB

Enable ELB health check (important!)

Desired Capacity: e.g., 2 instances

Min: 1

Max: 3 (or more, depending on your use case)

Scaling Policies (optional):

Enable dynamic scaling based on CPU or custom metrics

Review and Click Create Auto Scaling Group

🔹 4. Testing the Setup
Stop or terminate one instance

Load Balancer should redirect traffic to healthy instance

ASG should automatically launch a replacement EC2
