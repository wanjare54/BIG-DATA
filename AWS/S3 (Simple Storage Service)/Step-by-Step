📦 3. Amazon S3 - Object Storage Explained
S3 stores data in the form of objects, which include:

Key: Name or identifier of the object (like a file name).

Value: Actual data/content (file, image, etc).

Example Structure:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Key": "myphoto.jpg",
  "Value": "binary image data"
}
🧠 4. Key Features of Amazon S3
✅ Object Storage Capabilities
You can store anything in object format:

Images, videos, documents, logs, backups

JSON, CSV, text files

Everything is stored with a unique key.

❌ Limitations
S3 is not mountable like a traditional file system (e.g., EBS).

It works on PUT/GET operations over the network using HTTP(S) API.

🌐 5. Accessibility and Redundancy
Global Access: S3 is globally accessible via the internet.

Buckets are Regional:

When you create a bucket, you select a region (e.g., us-east-1, ap-south-1).

Helps with latency optimization and compliance.

S3 handles replication, redundancy, and high availability behind the scenes.

🔁 6. Use Cases
Website image hosting

Backup and disaster recovery

Data lake for analytics

Storing logs or IoT data

Static website hosting

==================----------------

☁️ How to Create an Amazon S3 Bucket – Step-by-Step
🔹 Step 1: Create Bucket
Begin by navigating to the S3 dashboard in the AWS Management Console and click on “Create Bucket.”

🔹 Step 2: General Configuration
✅ Bucket Name
Must be globally unique.

Acts like a container to store your objects (files).

Example: test-bucket-akash

🔹 Step 3: Select AWS Region
Choose the AWS Region closest to your users or applications for low latency.

Example:

scss
Copy
Edit
Asia Pacific (Mumbai) [ap-south-1]
🔹 Step 4: Set Object Ownership
Options:
✅ ACLs disabled (recommended):

The bucket owner (you) owns all objects placed in the bucket.

Better for centralized ownership and secure access control.

⭕ ACLs enabled:

Objects in the bucket can be owned by other AWS accounts.

Used in complex sharing or legacy scenarios.

🔐 Best Practice: Keep ACLs disabled unless there's a specific need.

🔹 Step 5: Block Public Access Settings
✅ Block all public access (recommended, especially for practice or secure environments).

text
Copy
Edit
[✔] Block all public access
⚠️ Only uncheck if you are intentionally making a static website or want public access to some files.

🔹 Step 6: Bucket Versioning
Provides protection by storing multiple versions of an object.

Helps in:

Recovery from accidental deletion or overwrite.

Backup/version tracking.

Options:
⭕ Disable (default)

✅ Enable (recommended)

📌 Summary of Key Best Practices:
Feature	Recommended Setting
Bucket Name	Globally Unique
Region	Closest to users
Object Ownership	ACLs Disabled
Public Access	Block All Public Access
Versioning	Enabled

🧠 Amazon S3 Expert Guide – End-to-End
🧱 PART 1: S3 Bucket Creation (Step-by-Step)
✅ Step 1: Start Bucket Creation
Go to AWS Console → S3 → Create bucket

✅ Step 2: General Configuration
Bucket Name: Must be globally unique (e.g., my-data-store-001)

Region: Choose closest to your users (e.g., ap-south-1 for Mumbai)

✅ Step 3: Object Ownership
🔘 ACLs Disabled (Recommended): Objects are owned by bucket owner.

⚪ ACLs Enabled: Other AWS accounts may own uploaded objects.

✅ Step 4: Block Public Access
☑ Block all public access (recommended unless hosting static site)

✅ Step 5: Bucket Versioning
☑ Enable (Protects against overwrites and deletions)

✅ Step 6: Default Encryption
☑ Server-Side Encryption (Enable for production)

Options: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C

✅ Step 7: Object Lock (Advanced)
☑ Enable (Prevents accidental deletions/overwrites – used for compliance)

📝 PART 2: Bucket Limitations & Upload Constraints
✅ You can store unlimited data in S3

✅ Max object size: 5 TB

🧭 Upload size limits:

Console upload: up to 160 GB

CLI/SDK single PUT: up to 5 GB

Use multi-part upload for larger files

💻 PART 3: AWS CLI & CloudShell for S3
🛠 Common CLI Commands:
bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 ls                          # List buckets
aws s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>       # List objects inside a bucket
aws s3 cp <file> s3://<bucket>     # Upload file
aws s3 rm s3://<bucket>/<file>     # Delete object
aws s3 mb s3://<bucket>            # Make new bucket
aws s3 sync . s3://<bucket>        # Sync local folder to bucket
☁️ Using AWS CloudShell:
Comes pre-installed with AWS CLI, Node.js, Python

1GB free persistent storage in the selected AWS region

No need for local CLI installation — perfect for organizations

🔁 PART 4: Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
🧭 Use Case:
Automatically replicate objects from one bucket to another (for DR, latency, etc.)

🔄 Steps to Enable Replication:
Go to source bucket → Management → Replication Rules

Name the rule: (e.g., cross-region-replication)

Enable the rule

Source bucket: select the current bucket

Rule Scope:

☑ Apply to all objects (recommended)

⚪ Limit to specific prefix/tags

Destination bucket:

Choose or specify destination (in another region)

Enable bucket versioning in both source and destination

Create IAM role with S3 replication permissions

Destination storage class:

Change if needed (e.g., Standard → Glacier for archival)

Additional Options:

☑ Delete marker replication (optional)

☑ Replica modification sync (metadata sync)

✅ Click Save

⚙️ PART 5: Batch Operations (Automation)
Create Batch Operation Job to run actions like tagging, restoring, copying, etc.

Example:

☑ Automatically run when ready

Use S3 inventory or CSV file to define target objects

🧙 Expert Tips
✅ Security:

Use S3 Block Public Access

Configure bucket policies + IAM roles

Enable MFA Delete for highly sensitive data

✅ Cost Optimization:

Use Intelligent-Tiering or Lifecycle Policies

Archive old files to S3 Glacier / Deep Archive

✅ Monitoring & Alerts:

Use AWS CloudWatch + S3 Access Logs
